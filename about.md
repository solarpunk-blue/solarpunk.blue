The Leftwardist is stories to imagine an equitable and sustainable world. Authors write social commentary about the ways our current societal inequities are detrimental to humanity's common well-being and speculative fiction about the ways we could reduce these inequities, live in balance with nature and create a world that lets all people enjoy life for generations to come.

Our goal is to shift people's attitudes towards a more egalitarian society in balance with the natural limits of our planet.  We seek to propagate stories and ideas centered on transitioning to a fair and sustainable world.  We seek to do this by making people think of all the small assumptions they make about where we are in humanity's development and what changes&mdash;small and large&mdash;we can make to move our world forward into a better future.
