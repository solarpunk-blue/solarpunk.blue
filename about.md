Solarpunk Blue is a place for stories to imagine an equitable and sustainable world in our near future. This solarpunk is blue not green. We contemplate what it will take for humanity to change itself, not just with "green" technological patches but in the deeper ways that humanity has struggled with for millenia. Solarpunk Blue focuses on the crucial social systems coming into place under a solarpunk revolution.

- Will it feel human to move beyond the quest for endless expansion?
- Can sustainability exist without equity?
- How can we find motivation in a world where competition is recognized as destructive?
- What will count as life when artificial intelligence occupies just as essential a niche in our ecosystems?

Solarpunk Blue is a space to propagate stories and ideas centered on transitioning to a fair and sustainable world.  We seek to do this by making people think of all the small assumptions they make about where we are in humanity's development and what changes&mdash;small and large&mdash;we can make to move our world forward into a better future.  In every solarpunk setting there is bright eye-catching green in the foreground: trees, farms, vine-covered buildings.  But in the background, undergirding utopia there is blue: clear sky, fresh water. The fundamentals needed for life to flourish.
