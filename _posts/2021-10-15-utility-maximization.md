While there are compelling moral arguments for greater equality in society, it's perhaps more interesting that there are actually really pragmatic arguments for why greater equality is actually beneficial.

Let me ask you a question.  Imagine you are trying to start a business and you know that it costs about the same to start a company that cleans 100 million peoples drinking water as it does to put 1 person into space. You know there is 1 person willing to spend $100 billion dollars to go to space, and 100 million people with only $10 who want clean drinking water.  Would you rather start a business that cleans 100 million people's water or one that puts 1 person into space?

Think that is too extreme?  Here's another challenge.

Imagine there are 100 million people with $100 to spend on books, and 6 billion people with $1 to spend on dental care to save their teeth.  Again you know those both have the same cost to produce, which business do you decide to start?


### The vicious cycle of resource deprivation in capitalism

Now it might not be quite clear what I'm driving at here so let me elaborate.  The above scenario is basically what has happened in the case of Jeff Bezos.  He started a company called Amazon with the knowledge that a lot of people would want to buy books online.  But importantly, he knew that those people already had plenty of money to buy those books. That was an implicit fact that caused him to make that decision. He didn't even think for a second about the billions of people who don't have much money for dental care, let alone books.  That didn't need to enter into his mind because he only had to focus on the segment of humanity that already had excess money.

From that, he acquired vast amounts of wealth with which he could literally purcahse anything he wanted.  So some engineers built a rocketship company for Mr Bezos because, again, they only needed to work on a thing that could be sold to someone with extra money.

This is the vicious cycle of a capitalist economy, all of the extremely useful things that could exist don't get made because it is far more profitable to start a company focusing on those who already have excess wealth.

### Markets as a decision making tool

For a long time now, human beings have been coming up with ways to allocate our time, effort, and natural resources to make the world easier and more ejoyable to live in for ourselves and each other.  There has been an ongoing challenge with this endeavor however: that it is incomprehensibly hard to figure out from the outset how to allocate resources to actually make people better off. To solve this problem as a society, many have argued that one of the best ways to get close to solving this problem is through the use of a distributed decision-making system known as a market.  We're all pretty familiar with markets, but just to make sure that the definition is clear, we can define a market as a system of exchange of goods where people set prices to allow for a transfer of anything available in an economy.  In general, for most things[^1], using a market to figure out who gets what makes a lot of sense.

To see why, imagine there are 2 people and 1 boat in an economy.  Now, the 2 people each want a boat to different degrees, but between them they can figure out what price they would put on the boat, relative to other things, and then the person who puts the highest price on the boat is the person that wants it the most.  They give up their money in a free exchange to take the boat and the other person does something else with their money.

However, in reality there is a huge flaw that prevents that from really working because the two people can have vastly different amounts of wealth with which to purchase the boat.  It could turn out that one person really needs the boat, because they live on an island and can't get to food unless they travel by boat to the mainland.   The other person could just be a very wealthy mainlander who wants to go for pleasure cruises and they set the price very high because they have a lot of extra money.

And this isn't even the worst problem because an important part of a market is that it sets expectations for what to produce.  So if in our example the wealthy mainlander only ever wanted an airplane, then all the boatmakers probably would switch their careers to make airplanes to satisfy the wealthy person. In that case, even when a simple and affordable boat is all the islander needs, there isn't anyone around to make it.

So is the market a good decision making tool? Are these cases just flukes?  Is there even a way to tell if this is a good system?

### Understanding utility maximization

To get into a little more of the nitty-gritty, utility theory is a way to mathematically describe how much good can be done with the resources on hand. This theory tries to describe how each thing in the world has some utility to any individual who is making use of it.  So you can assign units of utility to different items.  So, you could put 1 unit of utility on a boat and 10 units of utility on a bicycle.  But importantly, the same thing can have very different utilities to different people.  For example, the boat could have a utility of 100 for the person who needs it to get food, but a utility of 1 for someone who just enjoys riding on it a few times a year.  Although it's impossible to quantify how much utility would be given to each person for each thing, it's often very easy to understand how utility varies for a person depending on how many of something someone has. Specifically we expect each unit of a resource to be progressively less valuable to aperson (this is often described as diminishing returns).   As an example, if someone has five bicycles they might not need a sixth one as badly as someone who has no bicycle but wants one.

Now even though its impossible to simultaneously measure all the utilities of everything in a society, our goal with a market is generally to allow people to spontaneously solve for their individual maximum utility, in the hope that this chaotic solution ends up giving us something close to the global maximum soltion.  If this were the case, then the utility of a thing would be well correlated with how much a person would be willing to spend on it. So in our example, we'd expect that someone would want to spend less money to get a sixth bike, while the person with no bike would pay full price. In fact the person with 5 bikes might even be willing to sell 4 of their bikes to have enough money for a boat.

However, markets will fail to set prices in a way that maximize everyone's utiltiy if people have vastly different amounts of money to spend.  If the person with six bicycles has $1000 extra dollars in the bank and is trying to make a collection of bicycles for their wall, then they could still pay full price.  But if the person who desperately needs the bike has no money in the bank, they will go without.

This will result in fundamentally lower utility (aka an underutililization of the resources that are available). If you want to make more people better off this would be a bad thing.



### Can markets optimize for utility?

Fortunately, there is just one key constraint needed to make it so that the price and utility are equivalent:  Everybody needs roughly the same amount of money stored up.

Now I'm not saying that everybody has to have the exact same amount of money, but the disparity can't be too great before this theory starts to break down.

For example, if 10% of the population has 90% of the wealth, then effectively all of the decision-making in that the market can provide is optimized for those 10%.

Sadly, we live on a planet where 10% of the population does possess 90% of the wealth.





[^1]: Now, right from the beginning we know that there should already be some limits on markets, like for example, no organization should be able to buy the components to make a nuclear weapon without some sort of approval.  But it's a good idea in general.

[^2]: One of the main counterarguments to this has been the emergence of a theory of subjective value.  In essence this boils down to, what something is worth is fundamentally equivalent to what someone would pay for it.  In our example of bicycles, subjective value theory suggests that the rich person's collection of unused bicycles is more valuable than putting a bicycle to use to transport a poor person, provided the rich person is willing to pay more. However, this idea has a truly monumental flaw that's actually quite obvious after a moments reflection. Under the subjective value theory, a rich person's opinion of the value sets the true value.  In other words, if something is expensive, it is so because people with great wealth have decided it is valuable.  To take this farther, the richest person in the world could set the price of anything in direct proportion to how much of the world's wealth they control.  And everyone else only has the ability to set the price because the richest person has decided it isn't valuable to them.

So to ask yourself whether you believe in subjective value, you simply have to ask yourself whether the richest person's opinions should determine the value of everything.
