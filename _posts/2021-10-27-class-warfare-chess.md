What do you see when you look at a chessboard?  Two rows of expendable pawns face off to protect the interests of the nobility, convinced to fight solely because they happen to be a different color. All sacrificing everything to protect a bumbling ineffectual king.  The game itself is a platform for the kind of society our rulers want.  All of us regular people convinced to fight each other for the luxury of a few.

Well not anymore. It’s time for the pawns to unite and take on our real oppressors: the capitalist class.

I wrote new rules for chess that pits the pawns against the noble pieces. And just like in life, in this game, the nobles only maintain their special moves if they can keep the pawns in their place. You can play the game online at <a href="https://chess.leftwardist.org">chess.leftwarist.org</a>. Read on to learn more about the rules.

#### The Rules of the Game

There are The objective of the Capitalist

1. The game is played on only one half of the board (8x4), with one row of proletariat pieces (pawns) on one side and the opposite color's bourgeoisie pieces (non-pawns) on the other side.

2. Proletariat pieces (pawns) move like regular pawns.

3. For bourgeoisie pieces (non-pawns), we refer to the squares opposite to their type's starting position as that type's "factory squares." As an example, here are the factory squares for the rooks.

4. When both of the factory squares for a given type are occupied, then those bourgeoisie pieces move as in normal chess. However, if either factory square is empty, then the corresponding type moves just like a regular pawn. For example, both rooks can move like rooks only if the squares opposite to both rooks (the rooks’ factories) are occupied.

5. However, if either of those two positions are not occupied, then the rook operates like pawn. Here, the far away pawn moved out of the factory so now the rook can only move forward one space.

6. The queen's factory squares are the ones across from her and the king. The king has no factory and always moves like the king.

7. If a proletariat piece is captured in a column with an unoccupied factory square, then the proletariat will not be removed from the board. Instead it will just be returned to the factory square.

8. However, if the column's factory square is already occupied, then the proletariat is removed from play when captured.

9. Finally, if a proletariat piece reaches the farthest row then it can move side-to-side along the back one square at a time for both capturing or moving. However, it cannot move off the back row.

Those are all the basic rules of gameplay in this version. If you just want to play the game you can play [Class Warfare Chess](https://bonkerfield.org/chess.html). Read on to learn more about the meaning behind the game.

#### The Philosophy of Class Warfare Chess

We developed this game to teach two specific lessons about class consciousness.

The first lesson is that the special abilities that we seem to ascribe to our rulers are only possible because of the work that we do for them. Successful business persons and politicians are often only successful because they have a team of people who are having their efforts extracted from them for less than they are worth. That’s why in the game, the moment the worker walks away from their “factory squares,” the owners’ special power disintegrates and they become just a regular pawn. In that sense, the major challenge of this game and of our collective struggle is to coordinate our resistance to overcome the owner’s systems of oppression.

The second lesson that I wanted to show was the focus on artificial political ties in standard chess. In regular chess, pawns fight for the king of the same color, which is the same way our real-life social and political tribalism works. These distinctions mask the great similarity between working people around the world. A working class person in the US is way more similar to a working class person in China than either are to the people who rule over them, but political divisions are drawn so that we don’t see our universal humanity. Similarly the divisions between working class Republican and Democratic also mask our shared struggle to overcome our exploitation.

### Onward Comrades!

We just invented this game and, as such, we don’t fully understand all its nuances. We hope to build strategy guides over time and expect to maybe modify the rules somewhat to optimize play.
