In 2018, Gallup conducted <a href="https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/243362/meaning-socialism-americans-today.aspx">a poll</a> to learn what most people in the US think of when they hear the word "socialism."  The poll compared responses in 2018 and 1949, and pointed out a big change in perception over the seven decades since the beginning of the Cold War.

One of the most interesting findings is that over that time there has been a shift away from considering socialism to mean "state control of business" to meaning "equality" and "benefits and services." The old perception (despite being incorrect, see below) made a lot of sense in relation to the main model of socialism that existed in the world at that time&mdash;the centrally planned, government-run economies of Russia and China. The new perception is much better aligned with the current understanding of socialism in Western European and South American democracies&mdash;of a country where everyone in society gets equal access to the kinds of benfits and services to increase the well-being of society as a whole.

I largely agree with the perception of socialism as a more fair distribution of the goods of society, but it wasn't until just a few years ago that I actually learned the actual definition of socialism. And while the perception is measurably changing[^1], I've encountered many people (particularly <a href="https://reddit.com/r/Capitalism">online</a>) who, just as I used to do, incorrectly identify socialism in terms of a centrally-planned bureaucratic government that tries to control everyone's lives and thoughts.

As it turns out there is a school of thought specifically dedicated to describing how socialism would work hand-in-hand with competitive markets. So to better explain what socialism is, I'd like to describe some of the main principles of the socio-economic philosophy called <em>market socialism</em>.


### Market Socialism in a Nutshell

Market socialism preserves the market society that we've come to rely on where people trade goods and services using money, but it changes one crucial detail.  Ultimately the difference between the two systems is only a question of framing our relationship to ownership of businesses and natural resources. Under capitalism the ownership of our economy belongs to those with great wealth, and they generally hire regular people to work and manage the resources they own. By contrast, under market socialism, ownership is transfered to society as a whole, with different institutions set up as the stewarding bodies of that ownership.


I'll get into more detail about how this has taken shape before and how it could in the future, but first we'll go over the two general changes that To understand what this change in fundamental ownership means, we need to break down ownership into its two core pieces: control and right to profit.

#### Control

Having ownership over a business or resource implies that one has control over how it gets used.  Owners get to decide ultimately what is done with their property.  This control is already regulated by society in ways that prevent owners from doing things that would be massively detrimental, like polluting or creating destructive weapons, but market socialism would take the degree of societal control further.

Under a market socialist system, the ultimate ownership of any resource or business would belong to society as a whole.  However, since this isn't very practical for everyone to be constantly controlling everything, the idea would be to establish management rights for resources or businesses in a form of a contract with the public.  This would allow the public much more ability to step in and stop businesses that were doing things that were outright harmful to society, like underpaying their workers to the point of starvation, or exploiting a natural resource that could be much more effectively be put to a different use.

This might sound radical, but it isn't entirely too different from the way the natural resources on our public lands work today. For example, on a parcel of BLM grazing land, a ranching company will petition the government for the right to put cattle on the land; a public process will follow that allows the ranchers to make use of the land, and if there are any issues that go against the public good (e.g. the land is already overgrazed, or the methane released will increase global warming), representatives of the community can come forward to block access to the resource.

This is in contrast to a conventional capitalist relationship when a rancher owns their own land.  Under a pure capitalist framework, the rancher would have the ability to do whatever they want with their livestock and land even when it's detrimental to the public good.  For example, they could overgraze a hillside to the point that it causes erosion, or they could treat their livestock with potentially harmful chemicals.

This is the change in framing of control between capitalism and socialism.  In capitalism, the owner gets the final say, while in socialism society gets the final say.  In this sense, we already live in what's called a "mixed economy," where society has some capacity to regulate, but the rights of owners are also central to decision-making.  To move in the direction of market socialism is just to negotiate where that fine line is between how much the company should control vs how much say society should have.

#### Rights to Profit

The second big thing about a market economy is the idea of profit. Individual companies make their decisions about production with the hope that they can sell their products for more money than it took to create them.  This motive for profit would still be an important factor that would allow a socialist market to function.  However, since the ownership of the company would ultimately be society as a whole, the profit distribution would no longer be to individual shareholders, but instead would be redistributed to everyone[^2].

Again, this may sound like a radical idea, but this has been carried out in several places (Normway, UAE, and Alaska), where profits from oil revenues have been nationalized and redistributed to all citizens.
