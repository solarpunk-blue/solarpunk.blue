I'm seeing a lot of people talk about socialist revolution in the face of climate change and capitalism's collapse.Â  What irks me about this rhetoric is how far removed it seems from the basis of reality. I think it's important to address the primary criticism of socialism:

> What do you do when you want to make a system that seems to break the laws of nature?

Now it's a common complaint of socialist ideas that they go against human nature, and while most of those complaints are steeped in misconceptions and the western historical falsification of a "human nature" being inherently selfish, many people have refuted this idea of the western worlds, there does remain some truth to the incontrovertible realities of the nature of biological life.

What does any ecosystem do when it's pushed to the limits of its carrying capacity? Some form of competition for scarce resources of energy takes place. In human society this competition with the natural world and with other species has always taken place even when individual cultures have enacted highly egalitarian and cooperative social structures.

And it is a fundamental property of any system structured this way, that noncooperation by one species can always destabilize the environment for everyone. In many ways, I think of white western imperial dominance as the proof that a small subset of invasive lifeform can "break out" under the right conditions and destabilize any system at equilibrium.

Nature allows this and no other habitat has spontaneously formed an ecosystem that can't be coopted this way. So how can we hope to?

To put it another way, how can a species formed by evolution in the presence of natural selection hope to evolve a new system that replaces survival of the fittest with a fundamentally humanist mechanism? And furthermore create one that outlasts any temporary power structures and precarious arrangement of social contracts in an ever changing environment?
I don't know, but we should grapple with it honestly as the hardest thing that has ever been done. The perfect challenge for a species growing bored of materialism.
