The Solarpunk Blue Forum is just a Discord server to discuss directional radicalism, ecosocialism, market socialism, solarpunk, speculative fiction, games for a better society, dynamical system simulation, and other positive visions for a more equitable and sustainable future.  Come on in and bring topics that you think would be interesting to discuss.
